# Bottom navigation

Bottom navigation bars allow movement between primary destinations in an app.

For more information on using the bottom navigation bar, go to the [design page](https://material.io/components/bottom-navigation/).


## Using bottom navigation

If there are any instructions on using the component that applies to all component variants (for example, installation or theming, accessiblity), include them here.

* Use an ordered list for ordered steps (`1.`)
* Use an unorered list for steps that have no particular order (`* `)

If there is a separate page that has instructions, link to that page.

## Bottom navigation example <!-- No variants, so no need for variant sections -->

The component example header should be one level below the component section header.

The Example section should have the following:
* 1-2 sentences to describe the example
* An image rendering whatever sample code is included
* A list of links to the applicable API(s) listed from highest level to lowest level: include both developer source (e.g., [developer.android.com], or as available) and GitHub source
* Provide example source code that can generate the example in the image. Mention any themes/settings used

Source code API:

* \<source class name\>
  * [Class description](developer site here)
  * [GitHub source](https://github.com/materials-components/)

The following example shows a bottom navigation bar with \<...\> icons.
