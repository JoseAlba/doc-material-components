# Text field

Text fields let users enter and edit text.

For more information on using text fields, go to the [design page](https://material.io/components/text-fields/).

The text field class consists of the following variants:

* [Filled text](#filled-text)
* [Outlined text](#outlined-text)

## Using text field

### Installation

### Theming

## Filled text

Filled text fields have more visual emphasis than outlined text fields, making them stand out when surrounded by other content and components.

### Filled text example

Source code API:

* \<source class name\>
  * [Class description](developer site here)
  * [GitHub source](https://github.com/materials-components/)

The following examples shows a filled text field with <code>color</code> text and <code>color</code> background.

## Outlined text

Outlined text fields have less visual emphasis than filled text fields. When they appear in places like forms, where many text fields are placed together, their reduced emphasis helps simplify the layout.

### Outlined text example

Source code API:

* \<source class name\>
  * [Class description](developer site here)
  * [GitHub source](https://github.com/materials-components/)

The following examples shows an outlined text field with <code>color</code> text and <code>color</code> outline.
