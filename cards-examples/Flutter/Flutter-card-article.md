## Using cards


### Making cards accessible

Flutter's card component APIs support labeling for accessibility. To use labels...

For more guidance on writing labels, go to [our page on how to write a good accessibility label](https://material.io/design/usability/accessibility.html#writing).

## Card
 
On mobile, a [cardâ€™s](https://material.io/components/cards/#specs) default elevation is 1dp, with a raised dragged elevation of 8dp.

### Card example
